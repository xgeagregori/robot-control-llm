Based on the scene description, here are the key points:  
  
- There are 3 cubes: purple, violet, and pink  
- The goal is to move all cubes to the lower left corner  
  
The robot should follow these steps:  
  
1. Identify the goal state:  
- Purple cube is in the lower left corner  
- Violet cube is in the lower left corner  
- Pink cube is in the lower left corner  
1. Pick up and move one cube at a time to achieve the goal state.  
  
Since no cubes have been moved yet, the next logical action is:  
  
Robot action: Pick up the purple cube and place it in the lower left corner.

Okay, let's analyze the updated scene:  
  
- The purple cube has been moved to the lower left corner.  
- The violet and pink cubes still need to be moved.  
  
The next step to achieve the goal state is to move the violet cube.  
  
So the next robot action is:  
  
Robot action: Pick up the violet cube and place it in the lower left corner.

Let's review the updated scene:  
  
- The purple and violet cubes are now in the lower left corner.  
- Only the pink cube remains to be moved.  
  
To achieve the goal state of having all cubes in the lower left corner, the next action should be:  
  
Robot action: Pick up the pink cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
  
This will complete the goal of moving all 3 cubes - purple, violet and pink - to the lower left corner.  
  
  
> Scene: You have completed ["Violet cube is in the lower left corner.", "Pink cube is in the lower left corner."]

>  
Based on the latest scene description, it seems that all 3 cubes - purple, violet and pink - have now been moved to the lower left corner as desired.  
  
The goal state has been achieved:  
  
- Purple cube is in the lower left corner  
- Violet cube is in the lower left corner  
- Pink cube is in the lower left corner  
  
Since all cubes are now in the correct position, there are no more actions needed by the robot.  
  
Therefore, the next robot action is:  
  
Robot action: None  
  
The task is complete.
