> What is the next robot action?  
>  
The next robot action is to pick up the purple cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
  
The robot has already completed the goal of moving the violet and pink cubes to the lower left corner. The purple cube is the only cube that is not in the lower left corner. Therefore, the robot's next action should be to pick up the purple cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
  
Here are the steps of the robot's thought process:  
  
1. **Understand the goal state.** The robot first needs to understand the goal state, which is to move all the cubes to the lower left corner.  
2. **Identify the cubes that are not in the lower left corner.** The robot then identifies the cubes that are not in the lower left corner. In this case, the purple cube is the only cube that is not in the lower left corner.  
3. **Choose an action to move the cube to the lower left corner.** The robot chooses an action to move the purple cube to the lower left corner. In this case, the robot will pick up the purple cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
4. **Execute the action.** The robot executes the action and moves the purple cube to the lower left corner.  
5. **Check if the goal state is achieved.** The robot checks if the goal state is achieved. In this case, the goal state is achieved because all the cubes are now in the lower left corner.  
  
Therefore, the next robot action is to pick up the purple cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
  
  
> Scene: You have completed ["Purple cube is in the lower left corner."]  
What is the next robot action?  
>  
The next robot action is **none**.  
  
The robot has already completed the goal of moving all the cubes to the lower left corner. The robot has a list of goals, and it only takes action when there is a goal that is not yet achieved. In this case, all of the goals have been achieved, so the robot does not need to take any action.  
  
Here are the steps of the robot's thought process:  
  
1. **Understand the goal state.** The robot first needs to understand the goal state, which is to move all the cubes to the lower left corner.  
2. **Check if the goal state is achieved.** The robot checks if the goal state is achieved. In this case, the goal state is achieved because all the cubes are now in the lower left corner.  
3. **If the goal state is achieved, do nothing.** If the goal state is achieved, the robot does not need to take any action.  
4. **If the goal state is not achieved, choose an action to achieve the goal.** If the goal state is not achieved, the robot chooses an action to achieve the goal. In this case, there are no goals that are not yet achieved, so the robot does not need to take any action.  
  
Therefore, the next robot action is **none**.
