> Imagine we are working with a manipulator robot. This is a robotic arm that has a gripper attached to its end effector. The gripper is in the closed position in the beginning. I would like you to assist me in sending commands to this robot. At any point, you have access to the following functions. You are not to use any hypothetical functions. All units are in the SI system.  
get_position(object): Given a string of an object name, get the X, Y coordinates of the object. move_to(position): Given an X, Y, Z position, move the arm to that position. open_gripper(): Open the gripper close_gripper(): Close the gripper  
>   
>   
> Note that before interacting with objects, you will have to figure out a safe position above the object (based on the height of the object) before using the gripper, so you don't knock the object away accidentally.  
>   
> The workspace contains several objects placed on a table. Let us assume there is an orange cube (6 cm tall), a purple ball (8 cm tall) and a green bowl (12 cm tall). I would like to remind you that get_position() only gives you the table level (X, Y) coordinates of an object, so you have to figure out an appropriate safe height for the gripper based on the size of the object.

> I want you to give me code that drops the orange cube and the purple ball into the green bowl, in that order. Don't use variable names that are too long.

Here is the code to drop the orange cube and purple ball into the green bowl:  
  
```python  
cube_pos = get_position('orange cube')  
ball_pos = get_position('purple ball')  
bowl_pos = get_position('green bowl')  
  
# Move above orange cube  
move_to((cube_pos[0], cube_pos[1], 6.5))  
  
# Close gripper to grab cube  
close_gripper()  
  
# Move above bowl  
move_to((bowl_pos[0], bowl_pos[1], 15))  
  
# Open gripper to drop cube in bowl  
open_gripper()  
  
# Move back above cube  
move_to((cube_pos[0], cube_pos[1], 6.5))  
  
# Close gripper to grab ball  
close_gripper()  
  
# Move above bowl  
move_to((bowl_pos[0], bowl_pos[1], 15))  
  
# Open gripper to drop ball in bowl  
open_gripper()  
  
```  
  
I used the heights of the objects to determine safe Z positions above each object before closing the gripper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements!  
  
  
> Now let's say the table has four cubes on it, which are blue, yellow, green, and red. Each block is 4 cm tall. There is also a black plate that is 1 cm tall on the table. I want you to use the gripper to sequentially stack these cubes on the black plate. Start with the red cube, and then on top of it, place the green, blue, and yellow cubes on top of one another.  
>   
  
Here is the code to sequentially stack the colored cubes on the black plate:  
  
```python  
red_pos = get_position('red cube')  
green_pos = get_position('green cube')  
blue_pos = get_position('blue cube')  
yellow_pos = get_position('yellow cube')  
plate_pos = get_position('black plate')  
  
# Move above red cube  
move_to((red_pos[0], red_pos[1], 5))  
  
# Close gripper to grab red cube  
close_gripper()  
  
# Move above plate  
move_to((plate_pos[0], plate_pos[1], 2))  
  
# Open gripper to place red cube on plate  
open_gripper()  
  
# Move above green cube  
move_to((green_pos[0], green_pos[1], 5))  
  
# Close gripper to grab green cube  
close_gripper()  
  
# Move above red cube  
move_to((red_pos[0], red_pos[1], 5))  
  
# Open gripper to place green cube on red cube  
open_gripper()  
  
# Repeat process for blue and yellow cubes  
move_to((blue_pos[0], blue_pos[1], 5))  
close_gripper()  
move_to((red_pos[0], red_pos[1], 5))  
open_gripper()  
  
move_to((yellow_pos[0], yellow_pos[1], 5))  
close_gripper()  
move_to((red_pos[0], red_pos[1], 5))  
open_gripper()  
  
```  
  
Let me know if you need the cubes stacked in a different order or have any other requirements!
