Here are the steps for the robot to move all the cubes to the lower left corner:  
  
1. Identify the goal state:  
["Purple cube is in the lower left corner.", "Violet cube is in the lower left corner.", "Pink cube is in the lower left corner."]  
2. Pick up the purple cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
Scene: "Purple cube is in the lower left corner."  
3. Pick up the violet cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
Scene: "Purple cube is in the lower left corner.","Violet cube is in the lower left corner."  
4. Pick up the pink cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
Scene: "Purple cube is in the lower left corner.","Violet cube is in the lower left corner.", "Pink cube is in the lower left corner."  
5. Check if all cubes are in the lower left corner.  
Thought: Goal state achieved.  
  
So in summary, the robot would sequentially pick up and place each cube in the lower left corner until all 3 cubes are in the desired location. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional examples!
