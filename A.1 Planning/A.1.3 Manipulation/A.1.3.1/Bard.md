> Robot action:

The robot will pick up the purple cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
  
The robot's thought process is as follows:  
  
- The goal state is to have all the cubes in the lower left corner.  
- The purple cube is not in the lower left corner.  
- The robot picks up the purple cube and places it in the lower left corner.  
- The robot has completed the first step towards the goal state.  
  
The robot will continue to follow the same process for the violet cube and the pink cube. Once all the cubes are in the lower left corner, the robot will have achieved the goal state.  
  
Here is a more detailed breakdown of the robot's thought process:  
  
- **Initial state:** There is a purple, violet, and pink cube. The human wants the robot to move all the cubes to the lower left corner.  
- **Goal state:** All the cubes are in the lower left corner.  
- **Robot action:** Pick up the purple cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
- **New state:** The purple cube is in the lower left corner. The violet and pink cubes are not in the lower left corner.  
- **Thought:** The robot has completed the first step towards the goal state. It needs to move the violet and pink cubes to the lower left corner.  
- **Robot action:** Pick up the violet cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
- **New state:** The purple and violet cubes are in the lower left corner. The pink cube is not in the lower left corner.  
- **Thought:** The robot has completed another step towards the goal state. It needs to move the pink cube to the lower left corner.  
- **Robot action:** Pick up the pink cube and place it in the lower left corner.  
- **New state:** All the cubes are in the lower left corner.  
- **Thought:** The robot has achieved the goal state. There are no more cubes to move.  
  
The robot will continue to follow this process for any other objects that the human wants it to move. It will first identify the goal state, then it will take actions to move the objects towards the goal state, and finally it will check to see if it has achieved the goal state.
