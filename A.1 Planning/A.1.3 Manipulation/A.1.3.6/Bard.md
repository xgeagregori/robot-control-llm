I see. The robot successfully found a banana on the table and brought it to the human.  
  
The human now wants something bubbly to drink. I can find some bubbly drinks in the fridge. Here are some options:  
  
- **Sparkling water** is a good choice for people who want a refreshing drink without any calories or sugar. There are many different flavors of sparkling water available, such as lemon, lime, and grapefruit.

- **Tonic water** is a type of carbonated water that contains added quinine. It is often used in gin and tonic cocktails. Tonic water can also be enjoyed on its own, but it is important to note that it does contain calories and sugar.

- **Champagne** is a type of sparkling wine that is typically served on special occasions. It is made from fermented grape juice and has a higher alcohol content than other types of bubbly drinks.
