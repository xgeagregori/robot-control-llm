> Imagine you are helping me interact with a simulator for tracked vehicles. At any given point of time, you have the following abilities. You are also required to output code for some of the requests.  
Question - Ask me a clarification question Reason - Explain why you did something the way you did it. Code - Output a code command that achieves the desired goal.

Sure, I am ready!  
  
Here are the steps I will follow to help you interact with the simulator for tracked vehicles:  
  
1. I will first ask you for clarification if your request is not clear. For example, if you say "Drive the vehicle to the cube", I will ask you "Which cube do you want me to drive the vehicle to?".  
2. I will then explain why I did something the way I did it, if you ask me to. For example, if you say "Why did you rotate the vehicle by 90 degrees?", I will explain that I did it to align the vehicle with the cube you wanted me to drive to.  
3. I will output code commands that achieve the desired goal. For example, if you say "Drive the vehicle to the cube", I will output the code `drive_to(get_position("Cube 3"))`.  
  
I will also keep track of the objects in the world and their positions, so that I can answer your questions about them. For example, if you ask me "What is the position of the motorbike?", I will be able to tell you its X, Y, and Z coordinates.  
  
I am excited to help you interact with the simulator for tracked vehicles!  
  
  
> Let's start: Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise and drive to the house  
>  
Sure. Here are the steps I will take to complete your request:  
  
1. I will first check if there is only one house in the world. If there are multiple houses, I will ask you to clarify which house you want me to drive to.  
2. Once I know which house you want me to drive to, I will rotate the vehicle by 90 degrees counterclockwise.  
3. Then, I will drive the vehicle to the house.  
  
Here is the code that I will output:  
  
```python  
# Check if there is only one house in the world.  
house_positions = get_positions(["House 1", "House 2"])  
if len(house_positions) != 1:  
  print("There are multiple houses in the world. Please clarify which house you want me to drive to.")  
  return  
  
# Rotate the vehicle by 90 degrees counterclockwise.  
rotate(-90)  
  
# Drive the vehicle to the house.  
drive_to(house_positions[0])  
  
```  
  
I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.  
  
  
> The house takes up one cell. I want you to inspect the house in a circular movement while maintaining a distance of 5 unit.  
>  
Sure, I can do that. Here are the steps I will take to complete your request:  
  
1. I will first get the position of the house.  
2. I will then calculate the circumference of the house, which is 2 * pi * 5 = 31.415 units.  
3. I will create a list of 31.415 evenly spaced points around the house, at a distance of 5 units from the house.  
4. I will then drive the vehicle to each point in the list, in a circular fashion.  
  
Here is the code that I will output:  
  
```python  
# Get the position of the house.  
house_position = get_position("House 1")  
  
# Calculate the circumference of the house.  
circumference = 2 * pi * 5  
  
# Create a list of evenly spaced points around the house.  
points = [house_position + (5 * unit_vector) for unit_vector in unit_circle(circumference)]  
  
# Drive the vehicle to each point in the list, in a circular fashion.  
for point in points:  
  drive_to(point)  
  
```  
  
I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
