Absolutely, I'm ready to assist you with the tracked vehicle simulator scenario. Please provide me with the actions you'd like to perform or any questions you have, and I'll help you navigate through the simulator using the provided commands and information.  
  
  
> Let's start: Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise and drive to the house  
>  
Sure, I understand. To accomplish this task, we'll first need to rotate the tracked vehicle by 90 degrees counterclockwise, and then drive it to the coordinates of the house. Here's how we can do it:  
  
```python  
# Rotate the tracked vehicle 90 degrees counterclockwise  
rotate(-90)  
  
# Get the coordinates of the house  
house_coordinates = coordinates_dict['house_1']  
  
# Drive the vehicle to the house  
drive_to(house_coordinates)  
  
```  
  
In this code, we first rotate the tracked vehicle counterclockwise by using the `rotate` function with an angle of `-90` degrees. Then, we retrieve the coordinates of the house from the `coordinates_dict` using the key `'house_1'`. Finally, we use the `drive_to` function to command the tracked vehicle to drive to the coordinates of the house.  
  
Let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to proceed with another task!  
  
  
> Now visit all trees in reverse order  
>  
Of course! To visit all the trees in reverse order, we'll retrieve the coordinates of each tree from the dictionary and drive the vehicle to each tree one by one. Here's how you can achieve this:  
  
```python  
# Get the coordinates of the trees in reverse order  
tree_names = ['tree_3', 'tree_2', 'tree_1']  
tree_coordinates = [coordinates_dict[name] for name in tree_names]  
  
# Iterate through the tree coordinates and drive to each tree  
for coordinates in tree_coordinates:  
    drive_to(coordinates)  
  
```  
  
In this code, we define a list of tree names in reverse order (`tree_names`) and then create a list of corresponding tree coordinates using a list comprehension. We then iterate through the `tree_coordinates` list and use the `drive_to` function to command the tracked vehicle to drive to each tree's coordinates.  
  
Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or have more tasks to perform!
