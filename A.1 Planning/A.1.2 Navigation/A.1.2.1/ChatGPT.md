Absolutely, I'm ready to assist you with interacting with the vehicle simulator using the provided commands. Please go ahead and let me know what you'd like to achieve or what you need help with!

Got it! To achieve the desired behavior of the vehicle moving towards the goal while avoiding obstacles, I'll use the provided commands and the information from the distance sensor. Here's how I'll approach it:  
  
1. Check the distance using the `get_distance()` function.  
2. If the distance is greater than or equal to 5 meters, drive the vehicle towards the goal.  
3. If the distance is less than 5 meters, drive the vehicle backwards by 2 meters.  
  
Here's the code that implements this logic:  
  
```python  
def avoid_obstacles_and_reach_goal(goal_position):  
    while True:  
        obstacle_distance = get_distance()  
  
        if obstacle_distance >= 5:  
            # Drive towards the goal  
            drive_to(goal_position)  
        else:  
            # Drive backwards by 2 meters and stop  
            drive_path([get_position('vehicle'), (goal_position[0], goal_position[1] - 2)])  
            # Stop the vehicle  
            drive_to(get_position('vehicle'))  
            break  # Exit the loop once we've avoided the obstacle and stopped  
  
# Replace the following line with the actual goal coordinates  
goal_coordinates = (x_goal, y_goal)  
avoid_obstacles_and_reach_goal(goal_coordinates)  
  
```  
  
Please provide the actual `goal_coordinates` (x_goal, y_goal) before using this code. This code will guide the vehicle towards the goal while taking into account the obstacle distance and avoiding obstacles if they are too close.  
  
  
> You are using the goal position to drive backwards instead of the vehicle position.  
>  
You're right, my apologies for the oversight. We should be using the vehicle's current position to calculate the position for driving backwards. Here's the corrected code:  
  
```python  
def avoid_obstacles_and_reach_goal(goal_position):  
    while True:  
        obstacle_distance = get_distance()  
        vehicle_position = get_position('vehicle')  
  
        if obstacle_distance >= 5:  
            # Drive towards the goal  
            drive_to(goal_position)  
        else:  
            # Calculate position for driving backwards  
            backward_position = (vehicle_position[0], vehicle_position[1] - 2)  
  
            # Drive backwards by 2 meters and stop  
            drive_path([vehicle_position, backward_position])  
            drive_to(vehicle_position)  # Stop the vehicle  
            break  # Exit the loop once we've avoided the obstacle and stopped  
  
# Replace the following line with the actual goal coordinates  
goal_coordinates = (x_goal, y_goal)  
avoid_obstacles_and_reach_goal(goal_coordinates)  
  
```  
  
Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate your understanding.
