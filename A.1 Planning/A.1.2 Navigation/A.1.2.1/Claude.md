Yes, I'm ready to help you interact with the vehicle simulator.

The vehicle is equipped with a distance sensor that returns the distance to the closest obstacle directly in front of the vehicle. You can access it by calling get_distance().  
I want you to make sure to drive only if there is at least 5 meters of distance in front of the vehicle. If not, you should drive backwards 2 meters and stop the vehicle. Got it?

Here is the code to achieve the goal of driving towards the given coordinates while avoiding obstacles:  
  
```python  
goal_x, goal_y = [given goal coordinates]  
  
current_pos = get_position('vehicle')  
while current_pos != [goal_x, goal_y]:  
  distance = get_distance()  
  if distance < 5:  
    drive_to([current_pos[0]-2, current_pos[1]])  
    break  
  else:  
    # drive towards goal in small steps  
    next_pos = [current_pos[0]+1, current_pos[1]]  
    if next_pos[0] > goal_x:  
      next_pos[0] = goal_x  
    if next_pos[1] > goal_y:  
      next_pos[1] = goal_y  
    drive_to(next_pos)  
    current_pos = next_pos  
  
```  
  
I check the distance sensor before driving at each step to make sure there is enough clearance in front of the vehicle. If not, I drive backwards 2 meters and stop to avoid collision. The goal coordinates are approached incrementally in small steps by adjusting just the x and y position by 1 at each step. This allows periodic reassessment of the obstacle situation.  
  
  
> You only increment the position in the X coordinates. Why do you assign the goal coordinates value to the next position coordinates?  
>  
You're right, my previous code was only incrementing the x position and not the y. I was directly assigning the goal y coordinate to the next position, which could result in a large jump not a small step. Here is the updated code:  
  
```python  
goal_x, goal_y = [given goal coordinates]  
  
current_pos = get_position('vehicle')  
while current_pos != [goal_x, goal_y]:  
  distance = get_distance()  
  if distance < 5:  
    drive_to([current_pos[0]-2, current_pos[1]])  
    break  
  
  # take small steps towards goal in both x and y  
  next_pos = [current_pos[0]+1, current_pos[1]+1]  
  if next_pos[0] > goal_x:  
    next_pos[0] = goal_x  
  if next_pos[1] > goal_y:  
    next_pos[1] = goal_y  
  
  drive_to(next_pos)  
  current_pos = next_pos  
  
```  
  
Now I'm incrementing both x and y positions by 1 at each step, assigning the goal coordinates only when the next position exceeds them. This will incrementally move the vehicle towards the goal in small steps in both dimensions. Apologies for missing that earlier!  
  
  
> What if the goal coordinates are negative  
>  
Good catch. My previous code assumed the goal coordinates would always be positive. To handle negative goal coordinates as well, I can update the logic as follows:  
  
```python  
goal_x, goal_y = [given goal coordinates]  
  
current_pos = get_position('vehicle')  
while current_pos != [goal_x, goal_y]:  
  
  distance = get_distance()  
  if distance < 5:  
    drive_to([current_pos[0]-2, current_pos[1]])  
    break  
  
  # calculate direction to move in for x and y  
  x_direction = 1 if goal_x > current_pos[0] else -1  
  y_direction = 1 if goal_y > current_pos[1] else -1  
  
  # take incremental step in the right direction  
  next_pos = [current_pos[0] + (1 * x_direction), current_pos[1] + (1 * y_direction)]  
  
  drive_to(next_pos)  
  current_pos = next_pos  
  
```  
  
Here I first calculate the direction to move in (positive or negative) for each axis based on whether the goal coordinate is greater or smaller than the current position. Then I increment the position by 1 in that direction. This allows handling negative goal coordinates as well.  
  
  
> You are moving diagonally, what if the obstacle is not there?  
>  
You're right, moving diagonally by incrementing x and y simultaneously may not be optimal if there is no obstacle directly in the path. In that case, we can first try moving directly towards the goal, and only do the incremental diagonal movement if an obstacle is detected:  
  
```python  
goal_x, goal_y = [given goal coordinates]  
  
current_pos = get_position('vehicle')  
  
# try driving straight to goal first  
drive_to([goal_x, goal_y])  
  
distance = get_distance()  
if distance < 5: # obstacle detected  
  
  # incrementally move towards goal  
  while current_pos != [goal_x, goal_y]:  
  
    x_direction = 1 if goal_x > current_pos[0] else -1  
    y_direction = 1 if goal_y > current_pos[1] else -1  
  
    next_pos = [current_pos[0] + (1 * x_direction), current_pos[1] + (1 * y_direction)]  
  
    drive_to(next_pos)  
    current_pos = next_pos  
  
```  
  
First I try to directly drive to the goal coordinates. If an obstacle is detected, then I switch to the incremental diagonal movement approach. This will optimize the path when there is a clear line of sight to the goal. Let me know if this makes sense!
