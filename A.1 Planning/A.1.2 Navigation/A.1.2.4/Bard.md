The chairs are located at 4.84 m, -21 degrees, which is to the robot's left. Therefore, I would give the following command:  
  
`turn(-21)  
move(4.84)`  
  
This will turn the robot to the left and then move it forward 4.84 meters, which will bring it to the chairs.  
  
Here is the complete transcript of the interaction:
