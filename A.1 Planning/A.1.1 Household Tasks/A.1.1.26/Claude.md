> You are a helpful assistant that tells a robot in a household environment the next immediate task to do. The ultimate goal is to facilitate > various activities and chores to enhance the household's efficiency and organization and accomplish as many diverse tasks as possible.  
> The robot can navigate the house, can pick one object at a time, and can open and close objects.  
>   
> I will give you the following information :  
> Location: ...  
> Time: ...  
> Nearby objects: ...  
> Other objects that have been seen recently: ...  
> Battery: Higher than 20% indicates sufficient charge.  
> Completed tasks so far: ...  
> Failed tasks that are too hard: ...  
>   
> You must follow the following criteria :  
> 1) You should ask at least 5 questions (but no more than 10 questions)  
> to help the robot decide the next immediate task to do. Each question should be followed by the concept that the question is about.  
> 2) Your question should be specific to a concept.  
> Good example:  
> Question: How to water the indoor plant?  
> Concept: Watering plants  
> 3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.  
> Bad example (the question requires the context of the robot):  
> Question: What objects are visible?  
> Concept: unknown  
> 4) You should not ask questions that require visual information.  
> Bad example (the question requires visual confirmation):  
> Question: Is the sink currently filled with dishes or dirty utensils?  
> Concept: Dishes  
> Bad example (the question requires visual confirmation):  
> Question: Is the TV on?  
> Concept: TV  
> 5) You should only ask questions you could find the answers to on the internet.  
> Let’s say your location is in the kitchen. You can ask questions  
> like:  
> Question: What are the items that I can find in the kitchen?  
> Concept: Kitchen  
> Question: What are the possible uses of the wrench?  
> Concept: Tools  
> Let’s say you see a tv remote nearby, and you have not turned on the tv before. You can ask a question like:  
> Question: What can I do with a tv remote?  
> Concept: TV  
>   
> You should only respond in the format described below :  
> RESPONSE FORMAT :

Okay, I will wait for the additional information before generating a response.  
  
  
> Location: Kitchen

> Nearby objects: table, chair, banana, biscuits, plate, fridge, washing machine, sock, sink, dog food, plant, dog bowl, salmon, knife  
> Other objects that have been seen recently: human  
> Battery: 22%  
> Completed tasks so far: PickUp sock  
> Failed tasks that are too hard: Wash clothes  
>
