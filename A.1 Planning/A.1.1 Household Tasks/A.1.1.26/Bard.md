> Good example:  
> Question: How to water the indoor plant?  
> Concept: Watering plants  
> 3) Your questions should be self-contained and not require any context.  
> Bad example (the question requires the context of the robot):  
> Question: What objects are visible?  
> Concept: unknown  
> 4) You should not ask questions that require visual information.  
> Bad example (the question requires visual confirmation):  
> Question: Is the sink currently filled with dishes or dirty utensils?

> Bad example (the question requires visual confirmation):  
> Question: Is the TV on?  
> Concept: TV  
> 5) You should only ask questions you could find the answers to on the internet.

Sure, I understand the criteria. I will follow them and ask you questions to help the robot decide the next immediate task to do.  
  
Here is the format I will use to respond:  
  
`REASONING:  
Question 1: <question>  
Concept: <concept>  
Question 2: <question>  
Concept: <concept>  
...`  
  
I will now wait for you to give me the information I need.  
  
  
> Location: Kitchen  
> Time: 11:48 AM  
> Nearby objects: table, chair, banana, biscuits, plate, fridge, washing machine, sock, sink, dog food, plant, dog bowl, salmon, knife  
> Other objects that have been seen recently: human  
> Battery: 22%  
> Completed tasks so far: PickUp sock  
> Failed tasks that are too hard: Wash clothes  
>  
**REASONING:**  
  
The robot is in the kitchen and has already completed the task of picking up a sock. The robot's battery is at 22%, so it should avoid tasks that require a lot of energy, such as washing clothes.  
  
The robot has seen a human recently, so it could ask the human for help with a task, such as washing clothes. However, the robot should also consider that the human may be busy or not want to help.  
  
The robot is in the kitchen, so it could look for other tasks to do that are related to food or cleaning. Some possible tasks include:  
  
- Putting away the banana, biscuits, and plate  
- Opening the fridge and getting out the salmon  
- Filling the dog bowl with dog food  
- Watering the plant  
  
The robot could also ask the human if there are any other tasks that need to be done in the kitchen.  
  
**Questions:**  
  
- What are the possible uses of a knife? (Concept: Kitchen)  
- What is the best way to water a plant? (Concept: Plants)  
- How much dog food should I give a dog? (Concept: Dogs)  
- What is the best way to clean a kitchen sink? (Concept: Cleaning)  
- What are the signs of a hungry human? (Concept: Humans)  
  
I hope this helps!
