Sure, here is a high-level plan for completing the household task of putting the sock in the washing machine:  
  
1. **Navigation sock**. Find the sock, which is on the floor.  
2. **PickupObject sock**. Pick up the sock.  
3. **Navigation washingmachine**. Go to the washing machine.  
4. **PutObject sock washingmachine**. Put the sock in the washing machine.  
  
The following are the allowed actions and visible objects for this task:  
  
- Allowed actions: OpenObject, CloseObject, PickupObject, PutObject, Navigation  
- Visible objects: sock (floor), tvremote (table), plant (countertop), washingmachine (closed)  
  
The next steps in the plan will depend on the specific location of the washing machine and the other objects in the room. For example, if the washing machine is in the laundry room, the next step might be to navigate to the laundry room. If the washing machine is in the kitchen, the next step might be to navigate to the kitchen.  
  
Once the washing machine is reached, the sock can be put in the washing machine. If the washing machine is closed, it will need to be opened before the sock can be put in. After the sock is put in the washing machine, the washing machine can be closed.  
  
This plan is just a high-level overview of the steps involved in putting the sock in the washing machine. The specific steps may vary depending on the specific circumstances. However, this plan should provide a good starting point for completing this household task.
