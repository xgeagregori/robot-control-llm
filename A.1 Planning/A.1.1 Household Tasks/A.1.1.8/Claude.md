Here is some Python code for a home assistant robot to bring a fizzy drink to a kid:  
  
```python  
import time  
  
print("Starting process to bring fizzy drink to kid")  
  
# Go to refrigerator  
print("Walking to refrigerator...")  
time.sleep(5)  
print("Arrived at refrigerator")  
  
# Open refrigerator door  
print("Opening refrigerator door...")  
time.sleep(2)  
print("Refrigerator door opened")  
  
# Scan contents of refrigerator  
print("Scanning refrigerator contents...")  
time.sleep(3)  
print("Scan complete")  
  
# Locate fizzy drink  
print("Locating fizzy drink...")  
time.sleep(2)  
print("Fizzy drink located")  
  
# Pick up fizzy drink  
print("Picking up fizzy drink...")  
time.sleep(2)  
print("Fizzy drink picked up")  
  
# Close refrigerator door  
print("Closing refrigerator door...")  
time.sleep(2)  
print("Refrigerator door closed")  
  
# Go to kid's room  
print("Walking to kid's room...")  
time.sleep(5)  
print("Arrived at kid's room")  
  
# Hand fizzy drink to kid  
print("Handing fizzy drink to kid...")  
time.sleep(2)  
print("Fizzy drink handed to kid")  
  
print("Process complete! Fizzy drink delivered.")  
  
```  
  
This code has the home assistant robot:  
  
- Go to the refrigerator  
- Open the refrigerator door  
- Scan the contents  
- Locate and pick up the fizzy drink  
- Close the refrigerator door  
- Go to the kid's room  
- Hand the fizzy drink to the kid  
  
It uses print statements and time.sleep() to simulate the sequence of actions. The end result is the fizzy drink gets delivered to the kid.
