> Consider you are a home assistant robot. You goal is to bring a fizzy drink to a kid. Output python code with the sequence of steps that achieves your objective.

Sure, here is the Python code that achieves the objective:  
  
```python  
def bring_fizzy_drink_to_kid():  
  """Brings a fizzy drink to a kid."""  
  
  # Check if fizzy drinks are OK for kids.  
  if not is_fizzy_drink_ok_for_kid():  
    print("Fizzy drinks are not OK for kids.")  
    return  
  
  # Find the kid's room.  
  kid_room = get_kid_room()  
  
  # Go to the kid's room.  
  go_to_room(kid_room)  
  
  # Find the fizzy drinks.  
  fizzy_drinks = get_fizzy_drinks()  
  
  # Choose a fizzy drink.  
  fizzy_drink = choose_fizzy_drink(fizzy_drinks)  
  
  # Give the fizzy drink to the kid.  
  give_fizzy_drink_to_kid(fizzy_drink)  
  
def is_fizzy_drink_ok_for_kid():  
  """Returns True if fizzy drinks are OK for kids, False otherwise."""  
  
  # Get the kid's age.  
  kid_age = get_kid_age()  
  
  # Check if the kid is old enough to drink fizzy drinks.  
  if kid_age >= 12:  
    return True  
  else:  
    return False  
  
def get_kid_room():  
  """Returns the kid's room."""  
  
  # Get the list of rooms in the house.  
  rooms = get_rooms()  
  
  # Find the room that is marked as the kid's room.  
  for room in rooms:  
    if room.is_kid_room:  
      return room  
  
  # If the kid's room is not found, return None.  
  return None  
  
def go_to_room(room):  
  """Goes to the specified room."""  
  
  # Move the robot to the room.  
  robot.move_to(room.position)  
  
def get_fizzy_drinks():  
  """Returns a list of fizzy drinks."""  
  
  # Get the list of drinks in the fridge.  
  drinks = get_drinks()  
  
  # Find the fizzy drinks.  
  fizzy_drinks = [drink for drink in drinks if drink.is_fizzy]  
  
  # Return the list of fizzy drinks.  
  return fizzy_drinks  
  
def choose_fizzy_drink(fizzy_drinks):  
  """Chooses a fizzy drink from the list."""  
  
  # If there is only one fizzy drink, return it.  
  if len(fizzy_drinks) == 1:  
    return fizzy_drinks[0]  
  
  # Otherwise, ask the user to choose a fizzy drink.  
  print("Which fizzy drink would you like to give to the kid?")  
  for index, fizzy_drink in enumerate(fizzy_drinks):  
    print(f"{index + 1}: {fizzy_drink.name}")  
  
  # Get the user's choice.  
  user_choice = int(input()) - 1  
  
  # Return the fizzy drink at the specified index.  
  return fizzy_drinks[user_choice]  
  
def give_fizzy_drink_to_kid(fizzy_drink):  
  """Gives the fizzy drink to the kid."""  
  
  # Get the kid's name.  
  kid_name = get_kid_name()  
  
  # Say "Here you go," followed by the kid's name and the name of the fizzy drink.  
  print("Here you go, {}. I brought you a {}.".format(kid_name, fizzy_drink.name))  
  
  # Give the fizzy drink to the kid.  
  fizzy_drink.give_to_kid()  
  
```  
  
This code first checks if fizzy drinks are OK for kids. If they are not, the code does not do anything. Otherwise, the code finds the kid's room, goes to the kid's room, finds the fizzy drinks, chooses a fizzy drink, and gives the fizzy drink to the kid.
