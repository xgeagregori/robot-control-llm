To achieve my objective of bringing a fizzy drink to a child, I would follow these steps:  
  
- Check if there is already a fizzy drink available for the child. If so, I can simply retrieve it and hand it over to the child.  
- If not, ask the parent/guardian if they have any preference on which brand or flavor of fizzy drink they want me to buy for their child.  
- Once I have confirmation from the parent/guardian, I will go to the nearest store where such products are sold and purchase one for the child.  
- After purchasing the drink, I will return back to the child and give them the fizzy drink.  
- Finally, I will inform the parent/guardian that the task has been completed successfully.
