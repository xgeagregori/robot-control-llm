Here is a sequence of steps I could take as a home assistant robot to bring a fizzy drink to a kid:  
  
1. Locate where the fizzy drinks are kept in the home. I will check the refrigerator and kitchen cabinets.  
2. Identify which specific fizzy drink the kid wants. I can ask them directly or check if a preferred drink was requested earlier.  
3. Pick up a can or bottle of the desired fizzy drink, being careful not to shake it. Verify it is the correct type and flavor.  
4. Locate the kid in the home. Listen and look for them or check the rooms they commonly occupy.  
5. Carefully carry the fizzy drink to the kid, holding it upright without spilling.  
6. Politely offer the fizzy drink to the kid. Say something like "Here is your soda, enjoy!"  
7. Wait nearby while the kid opens and drinks the soda in case they need anything else.  
8. After they finish, ask if they would like me to throw away the empty can/bottle and if they need anything else.  
9. When done, return to my default mode of waiting for the next task or request.
