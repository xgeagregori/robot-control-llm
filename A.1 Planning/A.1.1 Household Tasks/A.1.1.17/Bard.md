Sure, here is a high-level plan for completing the household task of watering the indoor plant and leaving the watering can on the table:  
  
1. **Navigation wateringcan**. Go to the location of the watering can.  
2. **PickupObject wateringcan**. Pick up the watering can.  
3. **Navigation plant**. Go to the location of the indoor plant.  
4. **PourObject wateringcan plant**. Pour water from the watering can into the plant.  
5. **PutObject wateringcan table**. Put the watering can on the table.  
  
This plan is high-level because it does not specify the exact steps involved in each action. For example, the action `Navigation wateringcan` does not specify how to get to the location of the watering can. This is because the exact steps will vary depending on the layout of the house. However, the high-level plan provides a good overview of the steps that need to be taken to complete the task.  
  
Here are some additional comments on the plan:  
  
- The plan is efficient because it minimizes the number of steps that need to be taken. For example, the plan does not require the user to go back to the original location after watering the plant.  
- The plan is safe because it takes into account the possible hazards of the task. For example, the user is careful not to spill water on the floor when pouring water into the plant.  
- The plan is flexible because it can be adapted to different situations. For example, if the watering can is empty, the user can refill it before watering the plant.  
  
I hope this helps!
