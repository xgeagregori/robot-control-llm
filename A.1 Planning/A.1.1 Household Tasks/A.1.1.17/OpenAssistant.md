To complete this task, you can follow these steps:  
  
1. Take out the watering can from the cupboard by using the "Navigation" action followed by "PickupObject".  
2. Fill up the watering can with water from the sink faucet by using the "PourObject" action twice - once with the watering can as the subject and then again with the sink faucet as the object.  
3. Use the "SliceObject" action if necessary to cut any leaves or flowers that may have grown too large for the watering can.  
4. Move over to the plant and use the "TiltObject" action to tilt the pot so that the excess water drains out. Then, use the "PourObject" action again to pour the water into the soil around the base of the plant.  
5. Finally, place the empty watering can back onto the table using the "PutObject" action.  
6. Optionally, you could take a picture of the successfully watered plant using your phone camera and share it with friends or family members.
