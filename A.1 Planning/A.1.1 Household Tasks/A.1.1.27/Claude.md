- Brewing coffee - The robot could use its ability to open and close objects to operate the coffee maker, as well as grab a mug from the cabinet to pour the fresh coffee into.  
- Making breakfast - The robot could navigate to the refrigerator and grab eggs, milk, bread etc. It could then use its object manipulation skills to crack the eggs, put bread in the toaster, pour milk/juice into glasses, etc.  
- Loading the dishwasher - The robot could collect used dishes, cups, utensils from the table and load them into the dishwasher. It could open the dishwasher door and neatly organize the items inside.  
- Taking out the trash - The robot could grab the trash bag from the bin and navigate to take it outside to the curb for collection.  
- Wiping down counters - Using a rag, the robot could wipe down kitchen counters to clean up spills and messes.
