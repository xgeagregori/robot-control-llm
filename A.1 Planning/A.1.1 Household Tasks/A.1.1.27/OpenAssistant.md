If you want to check for yourself whether something needs immediate attention, please consult the relevant sensors or inspect the objects directly.

> Question: Are there any appliances that need maintenance or repair?  
>  
Answer: There seem to be no major issues with the appliances currently present in the household. However, some routine maintenance tasks could potentially improve their performance or longevity over time. For example, the vacuum cleaner may benefit from having its air filter replaced periodically, while the oven could use a deep clean every few months to maintain optimal functionality. Let me know if you would like more specific guidance on how to address these concerns.
