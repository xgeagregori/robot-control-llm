Here is a high-level plan for completing the household task of putting the salmon on the plate and the plate in the fridge:  
  
1. **Navigation salmon**. Find the salmon in the kitchen.  
2. **PickupObject salmon**. Pick up the salmon.  
3. **Navigation plate**. Find the plate in the kitchen.  
4. **PutObject salmon plate**. Put the salmon on the plate.  
5. **Navigation fridge**. Go to the fridge.  
6. **OpenObject fridge**. Open the fridge.  
7. **PutObject plate fridge**. Put the plate in the fridge.  
8. **CloseObject fridge**. Close the fridge.  
  
Here is a more detailed explanation of each step:  
  
1. **Navigation salmon**. The salmon is a moveable object, so we can use the `Navigation` action to find it. We can search the kitchen for the salmon by looking in the fridge, on the counter, or in the sink.  
2. **PickupObject salmon**. Once we have found the salmon, we can use the `PickupObject` action to pick it up.  
3. **Navigation plate**. The plate is also a moveable object, so we can use the `Navigation` action to find it. We can search the kitchen for the plate by looking on the table, in the sink, or in the cupboards.  
4. **PutObject salmon plate**. Once we have found the plate, we can use the `PutObject` action to put the salmon on the plate.  
5. **Navigation fridge**. The fridge is an open/close object, so we can use the `Navigation` action to go to it.  
6. **OpenObject fridge**. Once we are at the fridge, we can use the `OpenObject` action to open it.  
7. **PutObject plate fridge**. Now that the fridge is open, we can use the `PutObject` action to put the plate inside.  
8. **CloseObject fridge**. Finally, we can use the `CloseObject` action to close the fridge.  
  
This is just one possible plan for completing this household task. There may be other ways to do it, depending on the specific objects in your kitchen and how they are arranged.
