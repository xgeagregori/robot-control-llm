Based on the information provided, it seems the robot has sufficient battery charge and has completed some tasks already, though some were too difficult. To continue gradually building up its skills through novel, achievable tasks, I would recommend the following:  
  
Reasoning: The robot has not attempted any interaction with objects yet. Starting with a simple object manipulation task could be a good next step.  
  
Task: PickUp cup
