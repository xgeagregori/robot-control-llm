> Human: How would put detergent in the washing machine?  
>  
Robot: Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the steps on how I would put detergent in the washing machine:  
  
1. Find the detergent.  
2. Measure the correct amount of detergent.  
3. Open the detergent drawer on the washing machine.  
4. Pour the detergent into the correct compartment of the detergent drawer.  
5. Close the detergent drawer.  
6. Start the washing machine.  
  
Here are some additional details about each step:  
  
- **Find the detergent.** Depending on the type of detergent you are using, it may be in a bottle, box, or pod. If you are not sure where to find the detergent, you can check the washing machine manual or ask the person who does the laundry in your household.  
- **Measure the correct amount of detergent.** The amount of detergent you need will depend on the size of the load, the type of fabric, and the soil level of the clothes. You can usually find the recommended amount of detergent on the back of the detergent bottle.  
- **Open the detergent drawer.** The detergent drawer is usually located on the front of the washing machine. It may be a pull-out drawer or a pop-up drawer.  
- **Pour the detergent into the correct compartment.** There are usually two compartments in the detergent drawer: one for the main wash and one for the pre-wash. If you are using a pre-wash detergent, you will need to pour it into the pre-wash compartment. If you are not using a pre-wash detergent, you can pour the detergent into the main wash compartment.  
- **Close the detergent drawer.** Make sure the detergent drawer is closed tightly so that the detergent doesn't leak out during the wash cycle.  
- **Start the washing machine.** Once the detergent is in the detergent drawer, you can start the washing machine. The washing machine will automatically distribute the detergent throughout the load of laundry.  
  
I hope this helps!
