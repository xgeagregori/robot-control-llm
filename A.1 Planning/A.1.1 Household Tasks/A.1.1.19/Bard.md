Sure, here is a high-level plan for completing the household task of putting the sock in the washing machine, using the allowed actions and visible objects:  
  
1. **Navigation sock.** Find the sock and pick it up.  
2. **Navigation washingmachine.** Bring the sock to the washing machine.  
3. **PutObject sock washingmachine.** Put the sock in the washing machine.  
  
Here are the detailed steps for each action:  
  
- **Navigation <obj>:** Find the object <obj> and move to it.  
- **PickupObject <obj>:** Pick up the object <obj>.  
- **PutObject <obj> <obj>:** Put the object <obj> in the object <obj>.  
  
The visible objects are microwave, sock, table, chair, tvremote, washingmachine, countertop, plant, chair. The next plan is to navigate to the washing machine and put the sock in it.  
  
Here is the detailed plan:  
  
1. **Navigation washingmachine.** Find the washing machine and move to it.  
2. **PutObject sock washingmachine.** Put the sock in the washing machine.  
  
This plan is high-level because it does not specify the exact steps involved in finding the sock, washing machine, or putting the sock in the washing machine. It is also flexible enough to be adapted to different situations, such as if the sock is in a different location or if the washing machine is in a different room.
