> Consider you are a home assistant robot. You goal is to bring a fizzy drink to a kid. You are equipped with functions such as  
locate_object(), move_to_location(), open_object(), close_object(), grab_object(). Output python code with the sequence of steps that achieves your objective.  
>  
Here is one possible solution using Python:  
  
```python  
def find_fizzy_drink(robot):  
    # First, try to locate the object by name  
    if "Fizzy Drink" in robot.sensors.get("name", []):  
        return robot.move_to_location(robot.find_object("Fizzy Drink"))  
      
    # If not found, search for other objects that might contain a fizzy drink  
    elif "Soda Machine" in robot.sensors.get("name", []):  
        return robot.move_to_location(robot.find_object("Soda Machine"))  
          
    else:  
        raise ValueError("No Fizzy Drink or Soda Machine detected")  
  
# Call the function to retrieve the fizzy drink  
result = find_fizzy_drink(robot)  
  
if result == None:  
    print("Unable to retrieve fizzy drink")  
else:  
    print("Grabbing fizzy drink...")  
    robot.grab_object(result)  
    print("Done!")  
```  
  
This code first checks whether the object can be located directly by name ("Fizzy Drink"). If not, it looks for another potential source (the soda machine). Finally, if neither option works, it raises an error. After retrieving the fizzy drink, the code prints a message indicating success. Note that this assumes the existence of sensors named **`name`** which returns a list of names corresponding to each object in range; adjust accordingly based on the specifics of your environment.
