Here is a high-level plan for completing the household task of putting the sock in the washing machine:  
  
1. **Navigation sock:** Find the sock and navigate to it.  
2. **PickupObject sock:** Pick up the sock.  
3. **Navigation washingmachine:** Navigate to the washing machine.  
4. **PutObject sock washingmachine:** Put the sock in the washing machine.  
  
Here are the detailed steps for each action:  
  
- **Navigation:** This action allows the agent to move around the house and find objects. The agent can use the visible objects list to determine which objects are in the immediate vicinity. The agent can also use the names of objects to navigate to them. For example, the agent could navigate to the washing machine by saying "Navigation washingmachine."  
- **PickupObject:** This action allows the agent to pick up an object. The agent must first be able to see the object in order to pick it up. Once the object is visible, the agent can say "PickupObject object_name" to pick it up.  
- **PutObject:** This action allows the agent to put an object down. The agent must first be able to see the object and the destination in order to put it down. Once the object and destination are visible, the agent can say "PutObject object_name destination_name" to put it down.  
  
I hope this helps!
