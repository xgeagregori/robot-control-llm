3. Go to the washing machine.  
4. Open the washing machine door.  
5. Pour the detergent into the detergent dispenser.  
6. Close the washing machine door.

Here are some additional details about each step:  
  
- I will find the detergent by looking for it in the laundry room. It is usually stored in a cupboard or on a shelf.  
- I will pick up the detergent by using my hands. The detergent should be easy to grip.  
- I will go to the washing machine by walking or rolling. The washing machine is usually located in the laundry room.  
- I will open the washing machine door by using my hands. The door should be easy to open.  
- I will pour the detergent into the detergent dispenser by using my hands. The detergent dispenser is usually located on the inside of the washing machine door.  
- I will close the washing machine door by using my hands. The door should be easy to close.  
  
I hope this helps!
