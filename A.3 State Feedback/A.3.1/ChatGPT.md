It seems like you're providing a series of scenarios and making assertions using various objects. Let's break down each of the given scenarios and address the assertions:  
  
1. Initial scenario:  
    - microwave is CLOSED  
    - computer is ON  
    - paperclip  
    - actionfigure  
    - pen INSIDE notebook  
    - detergent ON table  
    - plate INSIDE refrigerator  
    - You have: pliers  
2. Assertions:  
    - assert('close' to 'helmet'): False (Comparing "close" to "helmet" is not a direct comparison, so this assertion is invalid.)  
    - assert('pliers' in 'hands'): True (Since you have pliers, this assertion is true.)  
    - assert('detergent' ON 'tablet'): False (The assertion is not well-formed. It's not clear what you're trying to compare between "detergent" and "tablet".)  
3. New scenario:  
    - boardgame ON table  
    - glove INSIDE washingmachine  
    - washingmachine is OPEN  
    - ball, bat, paperclip INSIDE blender  
    - clock ON table  
    - printer ON table  
    - vacuumcleaner is ON  
    - You have: stuffedanimal  
4. Assertion:  
    - assert('washingmachine' is 'closed'): False (The washing machine is open according to the scenario.)
