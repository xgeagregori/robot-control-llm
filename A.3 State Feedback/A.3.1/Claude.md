Okay, let's break this down:  
  
You described a scene with objects in various locations and states. I don't actually see anything, I'm an AI assistant without visual perception capabilities.  
  
You listed some objects I have, including "pliers".  
  
You asked me to evaluate some assertions based on the scene description:  
  
- 'close' to 'helmet' - False, there is no mention of a helmet in the scene.  
- 'pliers' in 'hands' - True, you said I have pliers.  
- 'detergent' ON 'tablet' - False, detergent was described as being on the table, not a tablet.  
  
You then described another scene with more objects.  
  
You said I have "stuffedanimal".  
  
You asked me to evaluate the assertion that the 'washingmachine' is 'closed'. Based on the scene description, this is False - you said the washingmachine is OPEN.  
  
So in summary:  
  
assert('washingmachine' is 'closed') = False
