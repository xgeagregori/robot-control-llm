Yes, the washing machine is open. I can tell because I see the glove inside the washing machine. It looks like someone must have left their laundry out and forgotten to put everything away before going to bed. If they had remembered, then the washing machine would likely be closed and locked up tight for the night. But since it's still open, that means there might be some dirty clothes waiting to be cleaned! Maybe we should remind them to finish their chores tomorrow so their stuff doesn't start smelling even worse than it already does... unless they were intentionally leaving things out as part of some kind of plan or experiment, but that seems pretty unlikely given how messy this place looks overall. What else can I help you find tonight?
