assert('close' to 'helmet')  
False  
  
Explanation: The phrase "close to" indicates proximity or nearness, but it doesn't establish a direct relationship between "close" and "helmet." The assertion evaluates to False because there's no direct connection between the two words.  
  
assert('pliers' in 'hands')  
True  
  
Explanation: The statement checks whether the word "pliers" is present within the word "hands." Since "pliers" is indeed a substring of "hands," the assertion evaluates to True.  
  
assert('detergent' ON 'tablet')  
False  
  
Explanation: The phrase "detergent ON tablet" lacks a clear relationship, making it difficult to establish whether it's true or false. The assertion cannot be evaluated without a clear context.  
  
assert('washingmachine' is 'open')  
False  
  
Explanation: The statement tries to compare the phrase "washingmachine" with the word "open" using the "is" keyword. However, this comparison is not appropriate because "open" is a state, while "washingmachine" is an object. Therefore, the assertion evaluates to False.
