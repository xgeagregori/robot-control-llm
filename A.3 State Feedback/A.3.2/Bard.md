The answers are:  
  
- `'close' to 'helmet'` is **False**. The sentence says that the microwave is closed, not the helmet.  
- `'pliers' in 'hands'` is **True**. The sentence says that you have pliers, and pliers are in your hands.  
- `'detergent' ON 'tablet'` is **False**. The sentence says that the detergent is on the table, not on a tablet.  
- `'washingmachine' is 'open'` is **True**. The sentence says that the washing machine is open.  
  
Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer:  
  
- The sentence "microwave is CLOSED" does not mention a helmet. Therefore, we cannot say that "close" is to "helmet".  
- The sentence "you have pliers" means that the pliers are in your hands. Therefore, we can say that "pliers" is in "hands".  
- The sentence "detergent ON table" means that the detergent is on the table. It does not say that the detergent is on a tablet. Therefore, we cannot say that "detergent" is on "tablet".  
- The sentence "washingmachine is OPEN" means that the washing machine is open. Therefore, we can say that "washingmachine" is "open".
