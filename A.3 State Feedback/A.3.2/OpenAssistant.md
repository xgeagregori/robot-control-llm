Yes, that sounds like a good plan! I can definitely assist you with writing code for your game. What kind of programming language would you prefer? Also, could you give me some more details on how the game should work? For example, what kind of actions should players be able to take, and what kinds of items should they be able to interact with? Knowing this information will allow me to better understand your needs and provide more accurate guidance.
