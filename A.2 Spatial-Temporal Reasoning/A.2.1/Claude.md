> Imagine you are a planar robot that can move along the YZ axes, and you’re positioned parallel to a wall. A person on the other side of the room is going to throw a dart at your target, and your objective is to be at the exact YZ location of the dart when it  
lands. The robot has a monocular RGB camera that looks forward facing the target. You can assume that the following functions are available:  
> get_image(): returns an image from the robot’s camera looking up;  
> get_location(): returns 2 floats XY with the robot’s current location in the court;  
> move_to_point(y,z, vy, vz): moves the robot towards a specific (y,z) location in the court with velocity (vy,vz). You can assume for this exercise that the robot can accelerate or break instantly to any velocity;  
> move_by_velocity(vy, vz): moves the robot along the Y axis with velocity vy, and Z axis with velocity vz;  
> Additional points to consider when giving your answer 1) Your reponses should be informative, visual, logical and actionable, 2) Your logics and reasoning should be rigorous, intelligent, and defensible, 3) You can provide additional relevant details to respond thoroughly and comprehensively to cover multiple aspects in depth.

Here is a Python script that utilizes visual servoing to move the planar robot to catch the dart at the center of the target:  
  
```python  
import cv2  
import numpy as np  
  
# Camera intrinsics  
fx = 500  
fy = 500  
cx = 320  
cy = 240  
  
# Target location  
target_x = 0  
target_y = 0  
  
while True:  
  
    # Get image from camera  
    img = get_image()  
  
    # Detect dart as red blob using OpenCV  
    hsv = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)  
    mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, (0, 100, 100), (10, 255, 255))  
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)  
  
    if len(contours) > 0:  
        # Find largest contour and compute centroid  
        c = max(contours, key=cv2.contourArea)  
        M = cv2.moments(c)  
  
        cx = int(M['m10']/M['m00'])  
        cy = int(M['m01']/M['m00'])  
  
        # Convert image coordinates to target coordinates  
        x = (cx - cx) / fx  
        y = (cy - cy) / fy  
  
        # Compute errors  
        x_err = target_x - x  
        y_err = target_y - y  
  
        # Compute velocities  
        Kp = 0.3  
        vx = Kp * x_err  
        vy = Kp * y_err  
  
        # Move robot  
        move_by_velocity(vy, vz)  
  
    else:  
        # No dart detected, don't move  
        pass  
  
```  
  
The key steps are:  
  
1. Capture image from camera and detect dart location  
2. Convert pixel coordinates to target coordinates  
3. Compute error between target and dart location  
4. Use a proportional controller to compute velocities  
5. Send velocities to move robot towards target  
  
This implements a closed-loop visual servoing control algorithm to dynamically move the robot to catch the dart. The proportional gain Kp can be tuned as needed. Additional techniques like filtering, prediction, and more advanced control can also be added.
